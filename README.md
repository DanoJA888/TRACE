This repository contains two distinct scripts for generating usernames and passwords:
1.	Script 1: Credential Generator with Markov Chains and Web Scraping
2.	Script 2: Credential Generator with Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
Both scripts aim to generate unique credentials, but they differ in their methodologies. This README explains the purpose, differences, and instructions for running each script. 

Install Steps:
•	Clone the repository or download the provided files.
•	Navigate to the project directory.
•	Install dependencies by running the following command: 
-	pip install –r requirements.txt

Script 1: Credential Generator with Markov Chains and Web Scraping
This script combines Markov Chains with a web scraping module to generate credentials. It collects text data from specified URLs, trains Markov Chain models, and uses them to produce usernames and passwords.
Key Features
•	Web Scraping:
-	Collects data from online sources.
-	Saved scraped content into a CSV file (web_text.csv).
-	Scrapes different types of content such as text from p, h1, h2, h3, and span tags, which allows for more diverse training data.
•	Markov Chain Modeling:
-	Trains separate models for usernames and passwords based on the collected data and a wordlist.
-	Generates usernames and passwords by learning character-level patterns.
•	Credential Generation

How to Works:
1.	Input Preparation:
-	wordlist.txt: The script requires a wordlist for training and generating credentials.
-	URLs: Modify the URLs list in the script to include the desired web pages for scraping.
2.	Web Scraping Process:
-	The script sends HTTP requests to the URLs using the requests library.
-	For each page, the script obtains HTML content and uses beautifulsoup to parse and extract relevant text.
-	The text is cleaned and stored in the web_text.csv file.
3.	Markov Chain Modeling:
-	The script uses two models, one for the usernames and one for the passwords.
-	The train method learns the relationship between character sequences and the following characters.
4.	Credential Generation:
-	Usernames are generated with a length of 5-8 characters
-	Passwords are generated with a length of 10-14 characters, which include a mix of numbers, special characters, and upper and lowercase letters.

Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7 or later: Ensure latest version is installed for better results
•	Required Libraries: numpy (can be installed separately using pip)
-	Ex. pip install numpy

How To Use:
1.	Prepare Input Files:
-	wordlist.txt: Contains sample words for training.
-	Modify the URLs list in the script to include the desired web pages for scraping.
2.	Run the Script:
-	Save the script and run the following command: python markovChain.py
3.	Observe Output: 
-	Web Scrapping: The web scraper saves the scraped content to a file named web_text.csv file. The file will include content of the scraped URLs including id, content, and URL.
o	ID: Unique identifier.
o	Content: Scraped text obtained from the URL.
o	URL: The URL the content was obtained from.
-	Generated Usernames and Passwords: The script generates usernames and passwords; these are printed to the console following the patterns learned from the scraped content and the wordlist.

Script 2: Credential Generator with MDPs
This script employs Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to generate usernames and passwords. It uses reinforcement learning and Q-learning to refine credential generation based on quality and strength criteria.
Key Features:
•	Username Quality
-	Evaluates length, uniqueness, and structure.
-	Ensures generated usernames are meaningful and don’t conflict with previously used ones
•	Password Strength
-	Scores based on length, diversity, and special characters
-	Adds random element to strengthen credentials further
•	MDP and Q-Learning
-	State transitions are learned and updated using Q-values

How it Works
1.	Input Preparation: 
-	The script requires a dataset (web_text.csv) and a wordlist (wordlist.txt) for training and generating credentials.
-	web_text.csv: A csv file with columns id, content, and URL. (Generated by running script 1).
-	wordlist.txt: Contains sample words for training.
2.	State Transition:
-	The script analyzes sequences of characters to build state transition maps for usernames and passwords.
-	Transitions are stored as state-action pairs, linking potential actions to their resulting states.
3.	Q-Learning for Credential Optimization:
-	Rewards are calculated based on username quality and password strength
-	Username Quality: Penalizes reused names, rewards structural patterns
-	Password Strength: Encourages diversity, length, and use of special characters
-	Q-values are updated iteratively to improve future credentials
4.	Credential Generation:
-	Starts with an initial state derived from the wordlist
-	Iteratively chooses actions to extend username/password
-	Ends with length or quality criteria are satisfied.
-	Adds additional randomization for security
5.	Password Enhancement:
-	Adds a capitalized character, a special character, and a random digit to strengthen password further
6.	Output:
-	Generates several username/password pairs

Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7 or later: Ensure the latest version is installed for better results.
•	Required Libraries: requests and beautifulsoup4 (can be installed separately using pip)
•	Input files: web_text.cvs and wordlist.txt

How to Use
4.	Prepare input Files:
-	Ensure web_text.cvs and wordlist.txt are saved in the same directory as the main script
5.	Run the Script:
-	Save the script and run the following command: python mdp3.py
6.	Observe Output:
-	Generated Usernames and Passwords: The script generates a list of usernames and passwords based on the MDP learning process.
-	The improved credentials are printed to the console.
Example: 
Username: skipe487, Password: Computerst%
