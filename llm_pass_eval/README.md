# LLM for Password Strength Evaluation

## Purpose

This code evaluates the strength of your passwords using a language model-based approach. It provides feedback indicating whether your passwords are strong or weak and includes an explanation to help you understand the assessment. While the evaluation may not always be perfectly accurate, the accompanying rationale offers valuable insights into potential weaknesses or strengths in your passwords. Use this feedback to identify patterns and improve your passwords' security with your MDP model as needed.
